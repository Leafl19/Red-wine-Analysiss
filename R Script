# Here is my process in R for correlation Analysis

# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
library(dplyr)
library(corrplot)

# Loaded the dataset 
red_wine <- read.csv("Downloads/Archive-5/wine-quality Red.csv")

# Viewed the first few rows of the dataset
head(red_wine)

# Got a summary of the dataset
summary(red_wine)

# Calculated the correlation matrix
cor_matrix <- cor(red_wine, use = "complete.obs")

# Displayed the correlation matrix
print(cor_matrix)

# Visualized the correlation matrix
corrplot(cor_matrix, method = "color", type = "upper", 
         tl.col = "black", tl.srt = 45, 
         col=colorRampPalette(c("blue", "white", "red"))(200),
         addCoef.col = "black")

# Reshaped the correlation matrix for export for Tableau dashboard creation
cor_melt <- melt(cor_matrix)
colnames(cor_melt) <- c("Variable1", "Variable2", "Correlation")

# Export the reshaped correlation matrix as a CSV file for further use (e.g., in Tableau)
write.csv(cor_melt, "red_wine_correlation_matrix.csv", row.names = FALSE)
